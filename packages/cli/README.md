# @rness/cli

The `rness` command: configuration-plane CLI for rness workspaces. It
resolves, validates and syncs an organisation's context for AI coding agents.
Not an agent — no LLM loop.

## Install

    npm create rness my-workspace   # prompts for the organization and, for a new workspace, the repositories to add
    npm i -g @rness/cli             # the command is `rness`
    npx @rness/cli --help

Inside a workspace, every `rness` delegates to the copy pinned in
`.rness/package.json`.

## Commands

    rness create [workspace] [--org <name>] [--repos a,b] [--pm npm|pnpm|yarn|bun] [--ssh] [--skip-install] -y
    rness add <repo> [--scopes apps/web,packages/ui] [--ssh] -y
    rness sync [--scope <name>] [--check] [--pull] -y
    rness context [--scope <name>] [--json]
    rness validate

`create` never runs inside a workspace. `add`, `sync` and `create` ask for
confirmation in a terminal; pass `-y`/`--yes` in scripts. `sync --check`
writes nothing and exits 1 when a block is out of date — use it in CI.

Exit codes: 0 success, 1 failure, 2 usage — or a refusal without a TTY.
`RNESS_DEBUG=1` adds stack traces; `RNESS_NO_DELEGATE=1` skips the delegation.

## 0.5.0 — create asks for the workspace and the organization

- `create <org>` became `create <workspace> --org <org>`: the argument names
  the workspace directory only, and the GitHub organization is its own,
  exact value. In a terminal, both are asked for when missing; in a script,
  pass both (with `npm create`, flags go after `--`:
  `npm create rness my-workspace -- --org acme --yes`).
- `--dir` is removed: the workspace argument is the directory.
- A new workspace no longer asks for a comma-separated list: it lists the
  organization's repositories to search and pick from. Without a
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) only public repositories are listed — and a
  personal account always lists only its public ones; add the others later
  with `rness add <repo>`. `--repos` still skips the picker.
- Repository names that differ only by case are declared in lowercase;
  names with `_` or `.` cannot be declared yet and are shown disabled.
- Organization names follow GitHub's rule — letters, digits and single
  hyphens, not at either end, at most 39 characters — in `--org` and in
  `rness.json`'s `"org"`; the case is kept as typed.
- `"org"` in `rness.json` now accepts uppercase letters: a 0.4.0 CLI rejects
  a workspace whose `"org"` has any, so upgrade every copy together.

## 0.4.0 — create, add, the shims

- `npm create rness <org>` starts a new workspace for `github.com/<org>` or
  joins its existing `.rness`.
- `rness add <repo>` clones (or adopts) a repository under `org/`, declares
  it and any `--scopes` sub-directories, then syncs.
- `create-rness` and `@rness/create` are two-file shims pinned to the exact
  same version as `@rness/cli`, so the short `npm create` commands run this
  CLI.
- A new workspace's scaffold ships a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  (`minimumReleaseAgeExclude: ['@rness/cli']`) — pnpm 12 otherwise refuses a
  version published less than 24h earlier.

## 0.3.0 — what changed for a 0.2.0 workspace

- The directory decides a file's scope. `scopes: […]` and `scope: global`
  front-matter keys no longer route anything; `rness validate` reports them.
  Move the file instead (`standards/<scope>/…` or the collection root).
- `rness.json` may declare `"org": "<github-org>"`; without it the
  workspace directory name is used and `validate` warns.
- `validate` now checks every generated block: a stale block is an error,
  a missing one a warning — run `rness sync`.

## Develop

    pnpm install                      # from the repository root
    pnpm --filter @rness/cli test     # node:test on the TypeScript sources
    pnpm --filter @rness/cli typecheck
    pnpm --filter @rness/cli build    # tsup → dist/
    RNESS_NO_DELEGATE=1 node packages/cli/src/bin/rness.ts --help

Inside a workspace whose `.rness/` pins a published `@rness/cli`, set
`RNESS_NO_DELEGATE=1` to run this source tree instead of delegating.
